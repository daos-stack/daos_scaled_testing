# daos_scaled_testing/frontera
This directory contains execution scripts for Frontera.

## Usage
See [DAOS on Frontera](https://daosio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DC/pages/4866835913/DAOS+on+Frontera)
for documentation on how to use these scripts.

## Version Compatibility
Not all versions of these scripts are compatible with all versions of DAOS.
It may be necessary to use a specific commit when building or running tests
against an older version of DAOS.
* It has proven difficult to keep track of which scripts to use with which commits.
